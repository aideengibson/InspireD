# Inspired

Inspired is an Appcelerator Titanium Mobile App Project.  It was designed and developed at Ulster University, with input from the Reminiscence Network NI, people living with dementia and their formal and informal carers.  

The source code is written in Javascript.  
When compiled using Appcelerator Studio, a mobile website and native Apps for IOS and Android are created.

Inspired is a system to facilitate personal reminiscence, designed to be used by a main user and their formal/ informal carer.  On first use, it is required that 2 users are set up with names and photos to identify themselves on logging in.  Multimedia prompts in the forms of pictures/ photos, videos and audios can be added by the Carer.  The Main user can then use the system to look at or listen to these prompts to help them to reminisce about their life memories.

The source code includes  the use of APIs for Flickr and YouTube.  Other features include accessing and interacting with the ios media App, email, camera, microphone, as well as photo and video libraries.
